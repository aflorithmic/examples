# simple-react

This is a simple demonstration of how to use the ApiAudio SDK in react to create text-to-speech. You will need an API key to begin. Visit console.api.audio to get one for free!

This demo was created with ViteJs using the react template. The only other package include is our SDK, apiaudio.

## Get Started

We use yarn here, but npm or pnpm can also be used.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to this directory

2. Install the dependencies with

### Running the application

```

2. Build the app with

```

3. You can see an example [here](https://apiaudio-example.onrender.com/) of it in action on [Render](www.render.com)
